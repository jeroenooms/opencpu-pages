This week a new package called [Sodium](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sodium/index.html) was released on CRAN. This package implements bindings to [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium#readme): a modern, easy-to-use software library for encryption, decryption, signatures, password hashing and more.

Libsodium is actually a portable fork of Daniel Bernstein's famous [NaCL](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/) crypto library, which provides the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools. It is not intended for implementing standardized protocols such as TLS, SSH or GPG. Sodium only supports a limited set of state-of-the-art elliptic curve methods, resulting in a simple but very powerful tool-kit for building secure applications.

### Getting started with Sodium

The package includes two nice vignettes to get you started:

 - [Introduction to Sodium for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sodium/vignettes/intro.html): basic hands-on introduction to the sodium R package. Gives an overview of the available encryption methods and examples of how to use them
 - [How does cryptography work](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sodium/vignettes/crypto101.html): a conceptual intro on cryptographic methods with examples from Sodium

 If you always wanted to understand how encryption works and didn't get a degree in computer science, check out the latter. The basic techniques are not that difficult to understand. Cryptographers have done a great job at abstracting the technicalities and mathematical details using hash functions and Diffie-Hellman functions. 

### Installing Sodium

On Windows on OSX simply install the binary packages from CRAN:

{% highlight r %}
install.packages("sodium")
{% endhighlight %}

On Linux you need sodium shared library which is called `libsodium-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu and `libsodium-devel` on Fedora/EPEL. Because this library is relatively young, it is only available for recent versions of these distributions. For Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 there are backports available from [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/ubuntu/libsodium):

{% highlight r %}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/libsodium
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsodium-dev
{% endhighlight %}

On CentOS/RHEL you need to [activate EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F) before installing `libsodium-devel`.
