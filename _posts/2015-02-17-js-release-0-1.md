A new package has appeared on CRAN called [js](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/js/). This package implements bindings to several popular JavaScript libraries for validating, reformating, optimizing and analyzing JavaScript code. It builds on the [V8](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/V8/vignettes/v8_intro.html) engine, the fully standalone JavaScript engine in R.

## Syntax Validation

Several R packages allow the user to supply JavaScript code to be used as callback function or configuration object within a visualization or web application. By validating in R that the JavaScript code is syntactically correct and of the right type before actually inserting it in the HTML, we can avoid many annoying bugs.

The `js_typeof` function simply calls the `typeof` operator on the given code. If the code is syntactically invalid, a SyntaxError will be raised.


{% highlight r %}
callback <- 'function(x, y){
  var z = x*y ;
  return z;
}'
js_typeof(callback)
# [1] "function"
{% endhighlight %}

Same for objects:


{% highlight r %}
conf <- '{
  foo : function (){},
  bar : 123
}'
js_typeof(conf)
# [1] "object"
{% endhighlight %}

Catch JavaScript typos:


{% highlight r %}
js_typeof('function(x,y){return x + y}}')
# Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): SyntaxError: Unexpected token }
{% endhighlight %}

## Script Validation

A JavaScript program typically consists of script with a collection of JavaScript statements. The `js_validate_script` function can be used to validate an entire script.


{% highlight r %}
jscode <- readLines(system.file("js/uglify.min.js", package="js"), warn = FALSE)
js_validate_script(jscode)
# [1] TRUE
{% endhighlight %}

Note that JavaScript does not allow for defining anonymous functions in the global scope:


{% highlight r %}
js_validate_script('function(x, y){return x + y}', error = FALSE)
# [1] FALSE
{% endhighlight %}

To validate individual functions or objects, use the `js_typeof` function.

## Uglify: reformatting and optimization

One of the most popular and powerful libraries for working with JavaScript code is [uglify-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js). This package provides an extensive toolkit for manipulating the syntax tree of a piece of JavaScript code.

The `uglify_reformat` function parses a string with code and then feeds it to the [uglify code generator](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen) which converts it back to a JavaScript text, with custom formatting options such as fixing whitespace, semicolons, etc.


{% highlight r %}
code <- "function test(x, y){ x = x || 1; y = y || 1; return x*y;}"
cat(uglify_reformat(code, beautify = TRUE, indent_level = 2))
# function test(x, y) {
#   x = x || 1;
#   y = y || 1;
#   return x * y;
# }
{% endhighlight %}

The more impressive part of uglify-js is the [compressor](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress) which refactors the entire syntax tree, effectively rewriting your code into a more compact but equivalent program. The `uglify_optimize` function in R is a simple wrapper which parses code and then feeds it to the compressor.


{% highlight r %}
cat(code)
# function test(x, y){ x = x || 1; y = y || 1; return x*y;}
cat(uglify_optimize(code))
# function test(x,y){return x=x||1,y=y||1,x*y}
{% endhighlight %}

You can pass [compressor options](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress) to `uglify_optimize` to control the various uglify optimization techniques.

## JSHint: code analysis

JSHint will automatically detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code. The `jshint` function is R will return a data frame where each row is a problem detected by the library (type, line and reason of error):


{% highlight r %}
code <- "var foo = 123"
jshint(code)
#
#       id                raw code      evidence line character  scope             reason
# 1 (error) Missing semicolon. W033 var foo = 123    1        14 (main) Missing semicolon.
{% endhighlight %}

JSHint has many [configuration options](http://jshint.com/docs/options/) to control which types of code propblems it will report on.
