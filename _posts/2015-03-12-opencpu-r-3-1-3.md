Following the release of R 3.1.3, I have pushed a new build of the OpenCPU server to [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~opencpu/+archive/ubuntu/opencpu-1.4), [dockerhub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/opencpu/base/) and [OBS](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Ajeroenooms%3Aopencpu-1.4&package=opencpu). This update has no changes in OpenCPU itself, but includes updated versions of R, RStudio and R packages used by OpenCPU.

To upgrade your OpenCPU server:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

If you are running OpenCPU in production and you do not want to receive automatic updates, make sure to remove or comment-out the opencpu repository in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/opencpu-opencpu-1_4-trusty.list` on your server. The [opencpu-1.4](https://launchpad.net/~opencpu/+archive/ubuntu/opencpu-1.4/+packages) repo now contains:

 - OpenCPU 1.4.6
 - R 3.1.3
 - RStudio Server 0.98.1103
 - Rcpp 0.11.5

To list the versions of other R packages included with the cloud server have a look at the [opencpu-lib](https://github.com/jeroenooms/opencpu-server/tree/v1.4.6/opencpu-lib) directory on Github or navigate to [`/ocpu/info`](http://cloud.opencpu.org/ocpu/info) on your opencpu server.
