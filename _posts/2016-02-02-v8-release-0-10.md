The V8 package provides an R interface to Google's open source JavaScript engine. The package is completely self contained and requires no runtime dependencies, making it very easy to execute JavaScript code from R. A hand full of CRAN packages use V8 to provide R bindings to useful JavaScript libraries. Have a look at the [v8 vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/V8/vignettes/v8_intro.html) to get started.

## Callback To R

New in version 0.10 is the ability to call back to R from within JavaScript using the `console.r` API. This is most easily demonstrated via V8's interactive JavaScript console:

{% highlight r %}
ctx <- V8::v8()
ctx$console()
{% endhighlight %}

From JavaScript we can read/write R objects via `console.r.get` and `console.r.assign`, analogous to `get` and `assign` in R. The final argument is an optional list with arguments passed to `toJSON` or `fromJSON` which are used behind the scenes to convert objects between R and JavaScript.

{% highlight js %}
// read the iris object into JS
var iris = console.r.get("iris")
var iris_col = console.r.get("iris", {dataframe : "col"})

//write an object back to the R session
console.r.assign("iris2", iris)
console.r.assign("iris3", iris, {simplifyVector : false})
{% endhighlight %}

Use `console.r.call` to call R functions. The first argument should be a string which evaluates to a function. The second argument contains a list of arguments passed to the function, similar to `do.call` in R. Both named and unnamed lists are supported. The return object is returned to JavaScript via JSON.

{% highlight js %}
//calls rnorm(n=2, mean=10, sd=5)
var out = console.r.call('rnorm', {n: 2,mean:10, sd:5})
var out = console.r.call('rnorm', [2, 20, 5])

//anonymous function
var out = console.r.call('function(x){x^2}', {x:12})
{% endhighlight %}

There is also a `console.r.eval` function, which evaluates raw R code. It takes only a single argument (the string to evaluate) and does not return anything. Output is printed to the console.

{% highlight js %}
console.r.eval('sessionInfo()')
{% endhighlight %}

Besides automatically converting objects, V8 also propagates exceptions between R, C++ and JavaScript up and down the stack. Hence you can catch R errors as JavaScript exceptions when calling an R function from JavaScript or vice versa. If nothing gets caught, exceptions bubble all the way up as R errors in your top-level R session.

{% highlight js %}
//raise an error in R
console.r.call('stop("ouch!")')

//catch error from JavaScript
try {
   console.r.call('stop("ouch!")')
} catch (e) {
   console.log("Uhoh R had an error: " + e)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Thanks to Barret Schloerke for [suggesting](https://github.com/jeroenooms/V8/issues/20) this feature and Dirk for pointing me in the right direction on how to call R functions from Rcpp (which is [surprisingly easy](https://github.com/jeroenooms/V8/blob/v0.10/src/V8.cpp#L75-L84)).
