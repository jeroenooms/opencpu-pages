Version 0.9.2 of [curl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=curl) has been released to CRAN. The curl package implements a modern and flexible web client for R and is the foundation for the popular [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=httr) package. This update includes mostly tweaks for Windows.

### Faster downloading

Alex Deng from Microsoft had diagnosed a problem with `curl_fetch_memory` (which is used by httr) being slower than expected on Windows. After some testing it turned out that the implemenation of `realloc` (to grow the buffer that holds downloaded data) is [poorly optimized](https://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/2be/realloc-on-Windows-vs-Linux.html) on Windows. It basically copies the entire memory block every time the size is increased, which results in a lot of copying for large downloads.

The new release includes a [tweak](https://github.com/cran/curl/blob/0.9.2/src/utils.c#L108) to increase the buffer size exponentially, which solves the problem. This fix is wrapped in an `#ifdef _WIN32` because usually the operating system does a better job in optimizing memory allocation than the programmer. But Windows needs a little help sometimes.

### Updated libcurl

This release uses the latest build of [libcurl](https://github.com/rwinlib/libcurl) and its dependencies from the [rwinlib](https://github.com/rwinlib) repository. These include:

   * libcurl 7.43.0
   * openssl 1.0.2d
   * libssh2 1.6.0
   * libiconv 1.14-5
   * libidn 1.31-1

The libcurl [changelog](http://curl.haxx.se/changes.html) lists the new features and bug fixes from this release. 

### Working with proxies

The new version includes two functions specifically for Windows to lookup system proxy settings. This can be used to configure curl to use the same proxy server, which is required to connect to the internet on some networks.

The `ie_proxy_info` function looks up your current proxy settings as configured in Internet Explorer. In the case of a dynamic proxy, the `ie_get_proxy_for_url` function shows if and which proxy should be used to connect to a particular URL. If your have an "automatic configuration script" this involves downloading and executing a [PAC file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config).

You *should* be able to use the proxy server returned by `ie_get_proxy_for_url` in the curl handle to automatically use the correct proxy server for a given URL. However I do not have access to a network with a proxy server so I cannot actually test this feature. If you are on such a network, please help testing this feature.

{% highlight r %}
curl_proxy <- function(url, verbose = TRUE){
  proxy <- ie_get_proxy_for_url(url)
  h <- new_handle(verbose = verbose, proxy = proxy)
  curl(url, handle = h)
}

con <- curl_proxy("https://httpbin.org/get")
readLines(con)
{% endhighlight %} 

I also created a [gist](https://gist.github.com/jeroenooms/1250e73f93acfffb0e9a) with some more details to test this feature. If it doesn't work immediately, try fiddling around with some of the other libcurl [proxy options](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html) and let me know what works!
