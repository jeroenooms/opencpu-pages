OpenCPU provides a mature and robust system for hosting R based services. The server exposes a simple [HTTP API](https://www.opencpu.org/api.html) for calling R functions, scripts and managing data. The Cloud Server is completely free and scales up to many concurrent users. This provides a reliable foundation for intergrating R into any environment. 

The 2.1 branch is the new major release of OpenCPU. The changes in this version are mostly internal, and make the server a bit lighter and faster. The built-in CI system has switched to the lightweight [remotes](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html) package for installing packages from GitHub. Moreover the `opencpu-server` package has been tweaked to work better inside docker. Also we now target R 3.5 on server installations.

The user facing features are unchanged; see the [opencpu 2.0 announcement post](https://www.opencpu.org/posts/opencpu-2-0/) for a brief overview.

## Upgrading

The version 2.1.0 is available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=opencpu), [Launchpad](https://www.opencpu.org/download.html), [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/opencpu), [OBS](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:jeroenooms:opencpu-2.1&package=opencpu) and the [server archive](https://archive.opencpu.org/).

The recommended platform for running the server is Ubuntu 18.04 or 16.04, which can be installed [directly from the PPA](https://www.opencpu.org/download.html). For Fedora and CentOS you can download installers from the [server achive](https://archive.opencpu.org/centos-6/). All binaries from the archive have been [built on dockerhub](https://www.opencpu.org/posts/opencpu-with-docker/) and depend on the current version of R from [Fedora / EPEL](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/R-devel).

The easiest way to get started is by deploying your packages on the [public cloud server](https://www.opencpu.org/cloud.html) by enabling the opencpu webhook in your GitHub repository.

## Docker 

Another easy way to get started is using docker, which also runs on Windows these days. Images based on various platforms are published on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/opencpu) The [opencpu/rstudio](https://hub.docker.com/r/opencpu/rstudio) image is recommended for development: it runs both `opencpu-server` and `rstudio-server` which are very powerful together.

```sh
# Run server as executable
docker run --name mybox -t -p 80:80 opencpu/rstudio

# OR: if port 80 is taken use port 8004
docker run --name mybox -t -p 8004:8004 opencpu/rstudio
```

Now simply open `http://localhost/ocpu/` and `http://localhost/rstudio/` in your browser! Login via rstudio with user: `opencpu` (passwd: `opencpu`) to build and install packages.

To connect to a running container (e.g. for installing system libraries) get a root shell:

```sh
# Replace 'mybox' with the container name or id
docker exec -i -t mybox /bin/bash
```

Use the [opencpu/base](https://hub.docker.com/r/opencpu/base) image for deployments. Also see the [docker readme](https://github.com/jeroen/opencpu-server/tree/master/docker#readme).
